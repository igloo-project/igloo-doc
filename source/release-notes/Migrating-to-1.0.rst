No longer supported

Password encoding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: **CoreLowerCaseShaPasswordEncoder**, **Md5PasswordEncoder**, **CoreShaPasswordEncoder** removed
   (Spring Security 5 update related)

To know if your application is compatible with new password encoding, please check stored passwords.
If your encoded passwords all start with ``$2a$`` (bcrypt marker), your application may be compatible.

If not you need to write your own password encoder based on code from previous versions. Please take care
of case insensitive check if **CoreLowerCaseShaPasswordEncoder** was used.

This page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt, your application configuration, and hashed password patterns
may allow you to identify password encoder behavior and identify needed use-cases.

If you upgrade your application, you should take into consideration to handle
all new passwords with modern hashing (use encoded password prefix to switch encoder behavior).

You should also consider `this paragraph from Spring documentation <https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/5.0.1.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#pe-history>`_
